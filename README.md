# Ansible
Ansible is an open-source automation tool that allows you to manage and configure computer systems, deploy applications, and orchestrate complex IT tasks. It is designed to simplify the process of automating tasks such as software deployment, configuration management, and infrastructure provisioning.

Ansible operates by connecting to remote systems through SSH or PowerShell, depending on the target system, and uses a simple, human-readable language called YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) to define automation tasks and configurations. These tasks are organized into reusable units called playbooks.

Playbooks in Ansible describe a set of desired states for systems and specify the steps needed to achieve those states. You can use playbooks to define configurations, install software packages, restart services, and perform various administrative tasks across multiple systems in a consistent and efficient manner.

One of the key features of Ansible is its agentless architecture. Unlike some other automation tools, Ansible does not require any software or daemons to be installed on the managed systems. Instead, it uses SSH or PowerShell to establish a connection and executes tasks remotely, making it lightweight and easy to set up.

Ansible is known for its simplicity and ease of use. Its declarative language and module-based approach make it accessible to both developers and system administrators, allowing them to automate routine tasks and manage infrastructure efficiently. Additionally, Ansible has a large and active community that contributes to its ecosystem, providing a wide range of pre-built modules and playbooks for various use cases.

Overall, Ansible simplifies the process of automating IT tasks and enables efficient management and configuration of systems, making it a popular choice for many organizations and individuals involved in system administration and DevOps practices.

    - Environment Variables
       In Ansible, environment variables are used to store and access information that can be used across playbooks, tasks, and roles. They provide a way to pass dynamic           values or configuration settings to Ansible during execution. Here's a brief explanation of Ansible environment variables:

       ANSIBLE_CONFIG: This variable allows you to specify the location of the Ansible configuration file. It can be set to the path of a specific configuration file to    override the default settings.
       ANSIBLE_INVENTORY: It defines the location of the inventory file, which contains information about the managed hosts. By setting this variable, you can use a different inventory file than the default one.
       ANSIBLE_REMOTE_USER: Specifies the username used for SSH connections to managed hosts. It allows you to override the default user defined in the inventory or playbooks.
       ANSIBLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE: This variable holds the path to the private key file used for SSH authentication. It can be set if you want to use a specific key file instead of the default SSH key.
       ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE: If you use Ansible Vault for encrypting sensitive data, this variable allows you to specify the path to a file containing the password for decrypting the vault-encrypted files.
       ANSIBLE_CALLBACK_PLUGINS: Specifies the path to custom callback plugins. Callback plugins are used to customize the output and behavior of Ansible during playbook execution.
       ANSIBLE_LIBRARY and ANSIBLE_MODULE_UTILS: These variables define the location of custom Ansible modules and module utilities, respectively. You can use them to extend Ansible's functionality by providing your own modules or utilities.
       ANSIBLE_RETRY_FILES_ENABLED: When set to "False," this variable disables the creation of retry files, which are used to track failed tasks and allow for automatic retries on subsequent playbook runs.

These are just a few examples of the environment variables used in Ansible.

    - Fact Variables
        In Ansible, fact variables are automatically generated variables that provide information about the managed hosts or the execution environment. These variables are collected by Ansible when it connects to the hosts and gathers information about their configuration, operating system, hardware, and other details.

    - Playbook Coditioning
        Playbook conditioning in Ansible refers to the ability to define conditions that determine whether a task or a set of tasks should be executed or skipped during playbook execution. It allows you to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions. This conditioning can be achieved using the "when" keyword in tasks or by using conditionals in Jinja2 templates.

    - Playbook Iteration
        Playbook iteration in Ansible refers to the ability to perform iterative operations or execute tasks repeatedly for a list of items. It allows you to apply the same set of tasks or configuration changes to multiple hosts or a group of variables.

    - Playbook Running ext scripts
        In Ansible, you can run external scripts or commands as part of your automation tasks using the "command" or "shell" modules. These modules allow you to execute arbitrary commands on remote hosts.
        
    - Playbook - templaters
        In Ansible, templating refers to the ability to dynamically generate configuration files or other text-based files using variables and templates. Templating allows you to create reusable and customizable configuration files by incorporating variable values and logic into the templates. Ansible uses Jinja2 as its default templating engine, which provides a powerful and flexible way to generate files based on templates.

    - Playbook - Handlers
        Handlers in Ansible are tasks that are associated with specific events and are triggered only when those events occur. They are used to respond to changes in the system state or specific conditions that need to be addressed. Handlers are typically defined in playbooks and executed at the end of a play or when explicitly called.

    - Ansible Roles
        In Ansible, roles are a way to organize and structure your playbooks and tasks into reusable units. Roles provide a modular approach to defining and managing configurations, making it easier to share and maintain your automation code. Here's a brief explanation of roles in Ansible:

    - Ansible Galaxy

    - Ansible with Windows

    - Ansible Tower
